				Working on the <a href="/shrines/snailfish">snailfish</a> page a bit, new color palette, new sketches, and some layout adjustments! Art is still sketchy but it's a closer approximation than the previous version. Can't do the final art until I have my tablet again, but hopefully soon I'd like to work on some content additions, better navigation between screens, and video updates.
